RATEngine Version 0.6 Build 2

RATEngine is an ambitious self-learning project to create a 3D game engine using the Python language. While it is designed to be somewhat playable, it's not expected to run at the same level of performance that code written in C or even on hardware can run. This is mostly a passion project that is designed to make the rendering process understandable and highly interactive.

Current features include:
  o Completely software based render pipeline
  o Model render distance
  o Triangle backface culling
  o Triangle clipping against 5 camera planes
  o Adjustable field of view
  o Adjustable resolution (non-resizeable window)
  o Real-time Phong shading supporting ambient, directional, point, and spot lights
  o Model parenting 
  o Vertex normals
  o OBJ model importing (functional but WIP still)
  o Basic model transformation functions
  o Depth buffer (fog depth and far clipping plane)
  o Texture transparency and translucency (translucent textures NOT performant)
